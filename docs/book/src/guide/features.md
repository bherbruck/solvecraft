# Solid features

Features live on the **timeline** and rebuild incrementally from the first one that changed.
Each one can be edited (double-click), suppressed, renamed, reordered (if nothing it depends on
moves after it), rolled back to, and deleted. Deleting asks first when other features depend on
it.

| Panel | Features |
|---|---|
| Create | extrude (one side, two sides, symmetric, taper, start offset, to a distance or through all; new body, join, cut, intersect), revolve, sweep, loft, box, cylinder, sphere, torus, coil, pipe, rib, web, emboss, hole (simple, counterbore, countersink, tapped; on faces or at sketch points), thread, rectangular/circular/path patterns, mirror |
| Modify | press pull, fillet, chamfer, shell, draft, scale, combine, split body, offset face, replace face, move/copy, align, remove |
| Construct | offset plane, plane at angle |
| Inspect | measure, section analysis, interference, curvature comb and map, zebra, draft, minimum radius, isocurves, centre of mass |

Fillets and chamfers handle straight edges between planar faces, whole smooth loops, runs of
neighbouring edges with mitred or spherical corners, and closed chains of curved edges (a rolling
ball). See the roadmap's known limitations for the rest.

Feature references to faces and edges are stored by name, so an upstream edit that moves geometry
keeps them on the right face (see [Persistent naming](../dev/naming.md)). When a reference can't
be found, the feature warns instead of silently picking another face.

Press **Delete** on anything selected (bodies, faces, sketches, features, planes, components,
canvases). It runs as one undoable step and lists the features that would go with it or fail.
